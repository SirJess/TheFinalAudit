# Inspiration

Our inspiration comes from the fact that learning about finance can be challenging, but when combined with gameplay, it becomes enjoyable. Thatâ€™s why we created a detective game where players uncover clues, explore financial concepts, and have fun while learning.

# What it does

**Final Audit** turns learning finance into an immersive detective adventure. Players step into a mystery where every room hides financial clues, waiting to be uncovered. By exploring different spaces, clicking on hidden objects, and piecing together key concepts like EBITDA, cash flow, and balance sheets, they gradually unravel the financial puzzle.

But discovery alone isnâ€™t enoughâ€”each room presents a challenge, a test of knowledge that must be solved to move forward. The faster players crack the case, the better their standing on the global leaderboard. With every step, finance transforms from numbers on a page into an interactive journey, making learning not just educational but truly exciting.

# How We Built It

### 1. Financial Document Processing

- We implemented a system where users **upload financial documents** such as the **balance sheet, shareholder equity sheet, and cash flow sheet**.
- To extract text from PDFs, we integrated **Google Cloud Vision OCR** into our backend.
- The extracted text is then processed using **Gemini LLM**, which converts it into a **structured JSON format**.
- This structured data is used to create **interactive quizzes** that test users on financial concepts.

### 2. Interactive Detective Game

- We designed an **immersive detective-style game** where players navigate different rooms.
- Each room contains **hidden clues** related to key financial concepts like **EBITDA, cash flow, and balance sheets**.
- Players can **click on clues** to learn about these topics in an engaging way.
- At the end of each room, a **puzzle** challenges players to apply their knowledge.
- Successfully solving the puzzle **unlocks the next room**, encouraging continuous learning.

### 3. Leaderboard & Competition

- To make the experience competitive, we implemented a **leaderboard system**.
- Players can **speed-run** through the game, with their **completion time** recorded.
- The leaderboard allows players to **compete with others** and track their progress.
- This adds an element of fun and motivation while reinforcing financial learning.

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Built with **React** for an interactive user experience.
  - React: The main library used for building the user interface.
  - React Router: For handling navigation and routing within the application.
  - Framer Motion: For animations and transitions.
  - Firebase Authentication: For user authentication and state management.
  - Radix UI: For dialog and other UI components.
- **Backend:** Node.js: The runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the server.
      - Express: The web framework for building the backend API.
  - Firebase Admin SDK: For server-side Firebase operations, such as verifying authentication tokens.
  - Python: For running scripts that process PDFs and generate JSON files.
  - Google Cloud Vision API: For OCR (Optical Character Recognition) processing of PDFs.
  - Google Cloud Storage: For storing and retrieving files.
  - Google Cloud Service Account: For authentication and authorization with Google Cloud services.
    **AI & OCR:** Used **Google Cloud Vision OCR** for text extraction and **Gemini LLM** for data structuring.

# Challenges We Ran Into

Working with PDFs proved to be a major challenge. Many were **encrypted** or difficult to convert, and even when successfully processed, **misaligned numbers** made extraction unreliable. Fine-tuning the AI model was crucial to ensure accurate text recognition.

Another obstacle was the **alternating black-and-white lines** in balance sheets, which confused the OCR and made text unreadable. To overcome this, we had to carefully **adjust grayscale levels and invert colors** to enhance text clarity.

Integrating **machine learning models** into our **React-based** frontend was also tricky, as they require a dedicated **server-side processing** pipeline.

# Accomplishments That We're Proud Of

Weâ€™re thrilled about what weâ€™ve built so far!

- **Creative Storyline** â€“ We designed an engaging detective narrative that makes learning finance feel like solving a mystery.
- **AI-Powered Learning** â€“ From **OCR processing** to **LLM-based data structuring**, we successfully integrated AI to turn financial documents into an interactive experience.
- **Interactive Gameplay** â€“ Players donâ€™t just read about finance; they **explore, discover clues, and solve puzzles**, making learning hands-on and fun.

Bringing these elements together has transformed finance education into something truly immersive! ðŸš€

## What's next for The Final Audit

- **Fine-tuning the AI** to improve accuracy in extracting and processing financial data.
- **Developing an AI agent** that uses **LLMs to dynamically quiz players**, making the learning experience more interactive and personalized.
- **Expanding game levels** by introducing **auto-generated rooms and puzzles** based on financial reports, ensuring endless challenges for players.

The goal is to make **Final Audit** even smarter, more engaging, and a must-play for anyone looking to master finance through gameplay! ðŸš€
